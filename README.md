# IP-Sanitizer
Script to sanitize IPs found in log files. Randomizes IP values found in a file and replaces all occurences of those IPs with their newly generated value.

Possible Future Improvements:
1. Only alllow legitimate IP's to be generated (currently allows IPs such as 0.123.0.123)
2. Implement support for CIDR notation
