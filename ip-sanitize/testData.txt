153.184.104.176
# Notice how this IP appears twice, the sanitizer will replace both lines when run.
# Both Here... 
184.80.157.66
26.194.138.197
115.77.10.81
# And here as well...
184.80.157.66
# It doesnt matter where the IP is in a line of text. 
# As long as it isn't fragmented the script will recognize it!
# For example: 
# My dog is an amazing 65.227.60.13 animal and there isnt anyone quite like 65.227.60.13 him
# His name is "65.227.60.13"
